    "\n",
    "We will try to build a model with our dataset which can predict the price of the car. The model will take car brand, model, year, km and other features as input and will predict the price of the car. We think that this model will be useful for people who want to buy a car and want to know the price of the car before they buy it. Also, this model will be useful for people who want to sell their car and want to know the price of the car before they sell it.\n",

    "## Roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build a algorithm that scan the data sources and get data from them. Then we will clean the data and prepare it for the model. After that we will build a model and train it with our dataset. Finally, we will test the model and try to improve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the model we will use linear regression, decision tree, SVM-support vector machine and random forest algorithms. We will try to improve the model with hyperparameter tuning if it is necessary and possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may use one hot encoding for categorical features to make them usable for our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For getting the data from the data sources we will use selenium and beautifulsoup libraries. For cleaning the data we will use pandas library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we will use sklearn library for building the model and training it. We will use matplotlib and seaborn libraries for visualizing the data and results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to use multiple algorithms for the model and compare the results. We will use the algorithm which gives the best result for our model.\n",

    "- Together: Test models, compare the results, improve models if it is necessary. Choose the best model for the project. Show the results with visualizations.\n",
