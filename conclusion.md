## Conclusion and Future Work

In this project we scraped the data from sahibinden.com and created a machine learning model to predict the car price in Turkey. Also we created an interactive playground to predict the car price based on user inputs. We used Linear Regression, SVM and Random Forest models. Models can be improved by using more data and tuning the hyperparameters. Also we can use other machine learning algorithms to improve the model.
